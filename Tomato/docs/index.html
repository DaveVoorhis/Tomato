<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tomato is an experimental prototype of a Java
application development environment.  It aims to replace text-based Java
programming with a point-and-click visual programming language. 

<p>Specialised visual programming languages have proven successful in
niche markets or genres, such as National Instruments' <a
href="http://www.labview.com/">LabVIEW</a>, the shader language in <a
href="http://www.sidefx.com/">Houdini</a>, or <a
href="http://www.toontalk.com/">ToonTalk</a>.  Visual programming has
not yet made a significant impact on general application development.
While efforts like Sun's <a href="http://java.sun.com/">BeanBox</a> or
the <a href="http://www.bluej.org/">BlueJ</a> project are promising,
they are limited in capability.  Tomato was created to explore the
application of visual programming to general purpose development.  To
our knowledge, Tomato is the first open source development tool of its
kind for the Java platform.

<p>The prototype works sufficiently -- though only barely -- to be
  used to develop parts of itself.  As parts of Tomato are developed
  in Tomato, the development process itself is being evaluated to find
  ways to improve Tomato.  Thus, Tomato development is shaped by
  real-world development requirements, rather than adherence to a
  predetermined abstract design.  This process of
  long-term ad-hoc prototyping<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> should
  either produce a working visual programming system, or
  leave a trail of empirical evidence to indicate why general purpose
  visual programming systems aren't viable.

<p>Once the Tomato prototype can handle most development tasks and
  demonstrate that general purpose visual programming is viable, it
  will be redesigned from scratch.  The next generation Tomato will be
  developed entirely within the final evolution of the Tomato
  prototype.

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>

<li>A visual programming language -- based on an "icons on strings"
metaphor -- for creating, testing, and compiling scripts and new Java
classes.  Java classes may be instantiated and manipulated at
design-time, which facilitates early testing, debugging, and
productive experimentation.  Program execution is displayed with
dynamic visualisation -- color changes are used to indicate method
invocation, variable assignments, etc., and these occur in real time.
The discrete stages of designing, writing, testing, debugging, and
compiling code are merged into a unified software modelling process.

<p>The visual language supports dynamic execution of source code
during development.  Programs can be assembled from small,
proven-working units, each test-run during construction.  Such units
may even continue to execute while they are assembled into a
whole.<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> This may represent a uniquely
powerful "run early, run always" development methodology.

<p><li>An integrated development environment to manage visual source
code and generate Java applications.  This is of a relatively
conventional design.

<p><li>A collection of useful reuseable Java classes with Java source
code, including database-enabled derivations of the standard JFC/Swing
widgets.  These may be used within Tomato or any other Java
development environment.

</ul>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>

<ul>
<li>Reduce application development time.  

<li>Reduce developer effort.  

<li>Reduce the opportunity for syntax and logic errors.

<li>Integrate prototyping, development, productive
experimentation, and testing into the development process from the
earliest stages.

<li>Automate and/or encourage best practices.

<li>Encourage the development of reuseable classes.

<li>Encourage the use of meta-programming.
</ul>


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

Tomato is a work in progress.  The current release is a mostly-working
prototype, suitable for experiments and creating simple classes
or test scripts, but it is not ready for production.

<p>Bugs are legion and the interface is clumsy.  Furthermore, the visual
scripting and class authoring facilities are incomplete.  It <i>is</i>
possible to write useful Java classes, but inner classes are not yet
supported, building expressions is laborious, and parameters cannot be
defined for new methods and constructors.  And so on.

<p>The documentation, including this document, is incomplete.

<p>These and other
limitations will be addressed in future versions.

<p>In other words, this tomato ain't ripe.  Tomato is being released
at this embryonic stage in order to develop interest (or at least
curiosity) and solicit feedback on the design.  Please don't inundate
us with bug reports.  We know it's buggy.



<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>

Tomato is a Java application, and should run wherever Java is
 available.  Tomato was developed under Linux, however, and has
 only been tested briefly under Windows.

<p>You will require a version 1.4.x Java 2 Platform and
 should have a Java compiler.

<p>See the <a href="#Download">Download and
 Installation</a> section below for URLs where you can obtain these.

<p>The Java compiler is optional, but without it you
 cannot compile new classes; you will only be able to work with
 existing Java classes.

<h2>License</h2>

We provide a unique bit pattern known as "Tomato".  As we have no way

<p>Tomato may not be used to test or develop applications where
vertebrate lifeforms may be harmed by a possible malfunction.  This
includes but is not limited to medical, weapons, and aircraft flight
control systems.

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<p>None yet...


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Current Version</h2>

The current release of Tomato is version 0.0.0-pre.



<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a name="Download">
<h2>Download and Installation</h2>

<ol>

<li>Download and install the Sun Java 2 Standard Edition SDK from <a
href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/download.html">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/download.html</a>.
Obtain the SDK, not the JRE.  The JRE (Java Runtime Edition) does not
include the Java compiler.

<p><li>(Optional) The Sun Java compiler is slow.  You may
wish to use the Jikes compiler, which is much faster.  Obtain it from
<a
href="http://www-124.ibm.com/developerworks/oss/jikes/">http://www-124.ibm.com/developerworks/oss/jikes/</a>.
Jikes is just the compiler -- you'll still need the Java 2 Platform.

<p><li>Download Tomato.zip to a directory of your choice.

</blockquote>

<p><li>Unzip the Tomato.zip, including all its

<h2>Running Tomato</h2>

<p>Note: In the following instructions, replace <code>&lt;directory&gt;</code> with the directory you created
in Step 4 under <a href="#Download">Download and Installation</a>.

<p><blockquote>
<p><b>Windows</b>:  Select "Start | Run", enter <code>java &lt;directory&gt;/Tomato</code>

<p><b>UNIX or Linux</b>:  Type <code>cd &lt;directory&gt;; java Tomato</code>

<p><b>MacOS</b>:  I have no idea.
</blockquote>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Bugs</h2>

So many they aren't listed...  Remember, this is a prototype!  Once
it reaches Alpha stage, we will start logging bugs.  

<p>The most annoying bug is that your visual programming source files
-- 'Models' in the Tomato parlance -- may occasionally become corrupt
when saved.  If you're sufficiently masochistic to use Tomato in
production, make frequent backups.

<a name="pronounce">
<h2>Taw-MAY-toe or taw-MAH-toe?</h2>

Neither.  The correct pronunciation is "TAWM-ah-toe", in order to avoid
confusion with a popular vegetable<sup><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup> of the same spelling.
